# Product_Authentication_System
A blockchain-based solution to combat counterfeit products and provide proof of ownership for legitimate items. This system leverages Flask, Ethereum Smart Contracts, IPFS, and QR codes to ensure transparency, immutability, and trust in product authentication.

📌 Features

Manufacturer Dashboard: Upload product details, generate a unique QR code for each item.

Admin Verification: Products validated by admin before being added to the blockchain.

Customer Mobile App: Scan QR codes to verify authenticity of products.

Proof of Ownership: Customers can append their name & number to a product’s digital identity.

Immutable Records: Product data stored on IPFS and Ethereum blockchain for tamper-proof logging.

End-to-End Transparency: Tracks product journey from manufacturer → admin → customer.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: Flask (Python)

Frontend: HTML, JavaScript

Blockchain: Ethereum (Ganache, Metamask, Solidity Smart Contracts)

Storage: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

Database: Blockchain ledger (immutable transactions)

Mobile: Android application (QR code scanning, product info retrieval)

🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-authentication-system.git
cd product-authentication-system

2. Set up virtual environment & install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Start Ganache (local blockchain)

Download & run Ganache

Configure with the contract address & ABI in blockchain.js

4. Deploy Smart Contracts

Open Remix IDE

Compile & deploy FakeProduct.sol (or equivalent contract)

Copy contract address into blockchain.js

5. Run Flask server
python app.py

6. Start IPFS
ipfs daemon

7. Mobile App

Install the Android app from mobile_app/

Use it to scan QR codes generated by the system.

🔮 Future Enhancements

AI-based camera authentication for automated validation.

End-to-end supply chain tracking.

Scalable deployment across industries (retail, e-commerce, asset tracking).

Self-service QR generation without admin validation.
